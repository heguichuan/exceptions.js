exceptions.js
======================
exceptions.js enhances Javscript error handling by providing a more comprehensive API for errors and by extending functionality of window.onerror.  exceptions.js is modeled off of C#'s exception infrastructure and provides the ability to record stacktraces, screenshots, inner exceptions with Javascript errors.  It also provides the ability to make post request that contain serialized exceptions so you can record and report Javascript errors.
